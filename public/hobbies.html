<h1>My Hobbies </h1>
<p>Hi there!<br/>
I'm Valery and to get to know me better I'd like to share with you what I like to do in my free time. </p>

<p>I consider myself a lover of many things, among them books, especially poetry, fantasy or personal growth.<br/>
  I love going out in search of a good cup of coffee.<br/>
  I am one of those people that if the day is nice, I go out of the house in search of new places to visit, to take pictures and eat good food.<br/>
  Sometimes I sit alone and write a bit or draw something, so we can say that it's something new.
</p>

<p>Cooking is another of my hobbies, especially if I'm doing it for someone else, I love to see their faces when someone try my food.<br/>
  I also like to dance and sing, more so when I'm alone, but if I'm at a party with people I feel comfortable with, we do karaoke and I don't sing so badly.<br/>
  ...and i have more things to share about me, people say that I'm a "box of surprises", but we can leave that for another time.
  <p>For now, that's a bit of myself!</p><br/>
<p>Just an introvert in a "wild world"...</p>
